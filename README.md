### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professional software engineer based in Lincoln, NE.  I've been doing full stack web development since sometime when jQuery was popular.  I'm currently working mostly on platform engineering & cloud infrastructure for work.  I'm a passionate rustacean ðŸ¦€ at heart, but I've used a little bit (and sometimes a lot bit) of everything over the years.

Welcome to my Github.  I'm always trying to find more time to code outside of work, so it's sparser than I want it to be, but I'm always trying to build something useful.
