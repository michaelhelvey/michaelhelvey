### Hi there! 👋

I'm a professional software engineer based in Lincoln, NE.  I've been doing full stack web development since sometime when jQuery was popular.

* ❤️ *Current Stack*: React/Remix/Tailwind/Prisma
* ⚙ *Main stuff I've used a lot at work*: Javascript (Typescript), Python, Go, Objective-C, PHP
* 👩‍💻 *Favorite languages*: Rust, most Lisps, Python, whatever I used last weekend
* 🏛 *Favorite frameworks*: Django, Remix, NextJS, some combination of Rust things

Welcome to my Github.  I'm always trying to find more time to code outside of work, so it's sparser than I want it to be, but I'm always trying to build something useful.
